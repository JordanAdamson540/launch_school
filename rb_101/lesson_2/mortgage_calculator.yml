user_greeting: |
  Hello %{one}. Hopefully, you will gain some utility out of
     this mortgage calculator.
to_borrow: |
  'How much would you like to borrow?'
     (Example: $100,000 should be entered as 100000)
     (Example: $250,000 should be entered as 250000)

pos_req: 'You must put a positive integer (no decimal and no useage of commas)'

  What is your annual interest rate? 
     (Example: 7% should be entered as .07)
     (Example: 8.25% should be entered as .0825)
     (Example: 25% should be entered as .25)
     (Example: 100% would be entered as 1)
percentage:  |
  I noticed you typed a percent sign. 
     Please convert the percentage to a decimal given the examples provided
zero_interest: | 
  You entered an interest rate of 0%, which is a bit abnormal in a
     lender and lendee society. Are you sure your lender is letting
     you borrow money for free?
zero_dollars: |
  You entered an amount of $0 (or a crazy value not defined in dollars),
     which cannot be the case when you are borrowing money.
     You must enter a positive value.
money: |
  You must enter a monetary value.
     (Only one decimal and two numbers after the decimal)
your_rate: |
  Your monthly interest rate will be... %{one}%%
     Note how your monthly rate has been rounded to the nearest basis point
     ##.#### (the farthest right pound sign) to make the numeric value understandable.
     Your actual interest rate (which is used in the final calculation) unrounded will be ...
actual_rate: '%{one}'
preditory: |
  Note that you entered a higher than normal value, 
     which means your APR is at or above 30%%. 
     This is in line with credit cards and preditory lenders, which is abnormal.
     You most likely meant to put...
     %{one} or %{two}
continue_apr: DO YOU WANT TO CONTINUE WITH YOUR APR BEING %{one}%%!!!!!?
duration_mon_yrs: Would you like to enter your loan duration in years or months (both options generate APR)?
years?: How many years would you like your loan to be?
months?: How many months would you like your loan to be?
no_decimal: Since you choose %{one}, you must use a number that also is without a decimal
payment: 'Your monthly payment is: %{one}'
yrs_or_months: You must select years or months
another?: Would you like to do another calculation?
goodbye: Thank you for using the mortgage calculator. Have a good day.
