welcome: 'Welcome to mortgage calculator'
to_borrow: 'How much would you like to borrow?'
pos_req: 'You must put a positive number'
ask_annual: |
  What is your annual interest rate? 
     (Example: 7% should be entered as .07)
your_rate: |
  Your monthly interest rate will be... %{one}%%
     Note how your monthly rate has been rounded to the nearest basis point
     ##.#### (the farthest right pound sign) to make the numeric value understandable.
     Your actual interest rate (which is used in the final calculation) unrounded will be ...
actual_rate: '%{one}'
preditory: |
  Note that you entered a higher than normal value, 
     which means your APR is above 30%%. 
     This is in line with credit cards and preditory lenders, which is abnormal.
     You most likely meant to put...
     %{one} or %{two}
continue_apr: Do you want to continue with your APR being %{one}%%?
duration_mon_yrs: Would you like to enter your loan duration in years or months (both options generate APR)?
years?: How many years would you like your loan to be?
months?: How many months would you like your loan to be?
no_decimal: Since you choose %{one}, you must use a number that also is without a decimal
payment: 'Your monthly payment is: %{one}'
yrs_or_months: You must select years or months
