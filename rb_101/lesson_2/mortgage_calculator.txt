You'll need three pieces of information:

the loan amount
the Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
the loan duration
From the above, you'll need to calculate the following things:

monthly interest rate
loan duration in months
monthly payment
=end

=begin
greet the user
get the loan amount from the user
  -the amount must be a positive float
get the interest rate from the user
  -the amount must be a positive float
  -show what the interest rate will be each month

get the loan duration from the user
  -the amount must be a positive integer
  -show how many months the user will have the loan
calculate the monthly payment
=end

=begin
BEGIN
PRINT greet the user
SET loan_amount = SUBPROCCESS GET loan amount from user (+ float)
SET interest_rate_months = SUBPROCCESS GET interest rate from user (+ float)
                             -convert to monthly interest rate
SET duration_months = SUBPROCESS GET the years from user (+ integer)
                        -convert to months
SET monthly_payment = SUBPROCESS formula for loan
PRINT monthly_payment
END
